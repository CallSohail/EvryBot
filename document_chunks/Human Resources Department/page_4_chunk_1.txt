A social worker supports staff in finding solutions to their problems of economic, social, medical,
psychological, etc. origin. She is also a disability advisor. In this capacity, she helps staff prepare files for recognition of disabled
worker status and find solutions to enable them to maintain professional activity within the University

also receive agents at their request. Appointments with the prevention doctor are managed by a HR manager. This person also manages the
retirement preparation procedures and informs all employees of their retirement rights (organization
