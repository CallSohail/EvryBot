HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT
Society's expectations in terms of higher education and research are significant and
constantly evolving. The University must play several key roles in parallel in building a
society whose operating rules are faced with numerous changes in all areas, including
the deployment of digital technology. Adapting work to numerous societal changes and sometimes contradictory issues
requires rapid transformation efforts that have a direct impact, in particular on
employment, the meaning of work and the skills to be implemented in higher education
and research professions. Faced with an exciting environment for some, where it is often necessary to improve
skills, the human resources function is now involved in a vast field of activities in the
service of the University's strategy and the development of staff. It is a privileged
contact for line managers, staff representatives and all agents.
